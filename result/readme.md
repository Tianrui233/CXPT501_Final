This is the statistical analysis but all of the tests return significance, tests are following:
1. For the sacubitril group, is there a significant difference between pre-treatment and Week 4 NT-proBNP levels? (2 Points)
2. For the sacubitril group, is there a significant difference between pre-treatment and Week 8 NT-proBNP levels? (2 Points)
3. For the enalapril group, is there a significant difference between pre-treatment and Week 4 NT-proBNP levels? (2 Points)
4. For the enalapril group, is there a significant difference between pre-treatment and Week 8 NT-proBNP levels? (2 Points)
5. Is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 4 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)? (2 Points)
6. Is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 8 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)? (2 Points)
7. Among participants aged 60 or older, is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 4 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)? (2 Points)
8. Among participants aged 60 or older, is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 8 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)? (2 Points)
